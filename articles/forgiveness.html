<h1 class="title">Forgiveness</h1>

<p>The concept of forgiving has had a major effect on society. These impacts have been so immensely important that it is hard to think of a world without forgiveness. Whenever people forgive it unlocks a magnitude of positive possibilities that are suddenly made possible. Forgiving allows both parties involved to feel better about the situation and move on; forgiving someone can change situations and the entire world for generations after generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whenever people get angry and hostile at there fellow man they typically want to hold on to that anger and hatred in the form of a grudge, they hold on to that grudge for a long and unappealing amount of time. This practice is harmful to both the recipient of the hatred that is held because of this grudge and the person holding the grudge. It forces both parties involved to have a less appealing mood and it also forces you to prolong the very thing you are so enraged about. If both of the parties involved in this state of affairs made the correct and mature decision to forgive each other they would feel better about each other and this unnecessarily hostile situation.
<br>
<br>
If someone were to look back in history to attempt to find the largest and most important case of large-scale forgiveness, they would quickly find that it is the case of Jesus Christ. Jesus was a modest carpenter that grew up in Nazareth; he would live a fairly normal life until he was about thirty years of age when he would start his ministry. He spread the good news across the region, that he was the son of God. When the leaders of Judaism heard this, they decided they would kill him. They decided to try and kill him with the most brutal forms of death available; death by hanging on a cross. When Jesus was hanging on that cross, he cried out that he forgave these people and that he forgave every one of there sins around the globe. This is truly the largest case of forgiveness and because of this case generations after generation have been affected through Christianity.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, forgiving can help people feel better about their lives and it can change the world. Forgiveness is a fundamental part of the human experience. Without forgiveness, people would rarely be happy because they would be too consumed by hatred or too worried about what other people could be mad at them for, but thanks to forgiveness we can make our lives and other people’s lives immensely better.
