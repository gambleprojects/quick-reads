<hr>
<p>At the 2019 Comic-Con in San Diego, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the plan for the entire next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Marvel is truly planning something big. In just one day they announced 10 new movies and shows. All of the new shows will be available exclusively on Disney’s new streaming service Disney Plus. The announced movies include Black Widow, The Eternals, Shang-Chi, and The Legend of the Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Thor: Love and Thunder. The Disney Plus shows that were announced where The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, WandaVision, Loki, What If…?, and Hawkeye.
  <br>
  <br>
  People have been waiting anxiously for Marvel to announce a Black Widow movie, now fans finally get their wishes… to some extent. The Black Widow movie is not an origin story as most people thought. The Movie takes place between “Captain America: Civil War” and “Avengers: Infinity War”. In the first movie to be made following “Avengers: Endgame” and “Spiderman: Far from Home” Scarlett Johansson will be returning to her role as Natasha Romanoff or as she is more commonly known Black Widow. She will revisit Budapest which has been mentioned in other Marvel films such as “Avengers: Endgame” by Clint Barton a.k.a. Hawkeye. Black Widow is will also encounter the famous comic book villain Taskmaster. In the comic books, Taskmaster could perfectly copy someone's exact movement once he had seen them do it, so Black Widow may have trouble doing her famous hand to hand combative style of fighting.
<br>
<br>
“The Falcon and The Winter Soldier” will be the first Disney Plus streaming Marvel show in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), coming out in the fall of 2020. This will star Anthony Mackie as the Falcon and Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. The show will most likely take place after the events of “Avengers: Endgame”, and show how two of Steve Rodger’s (Captain America’s) closest friends will react to him stepping down as Captain America and passing the shield to Sam Wilson (Falcon). We may even get cameos of Chris Evan’s Steve Rodgers, but it is unlikely that he will be one of the main characters due to his very old age of about 114 years or about 180 if you count him being frozen, at the end of “Avengers: Endgame”. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier will showcase another famous comic book villain Baron Zemo returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) played again by Daniel Bruhl. The Last time we saw Baron Zemo was in “Captain America: Civil War” after he had tried to turn the Avengers on each other and mind control Bucky Barns (Winter Soldier), by reading the words that trigger Barns and make him follow Hydra commands. In the Comic-Con trailer for The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, we hear Baron Zemo reading the same words. The trailer also showed him in his famous comic-based purple mask for the first time.
<br>
<br>
The “Eternals” is going to likely be one of the weirdest Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies in a while. It is going to the very origins of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), literally almost the beginning of time. The movie stars Angelina Jolie as Thena, Richard Madden as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Sama Hayek as Ajak, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Dong-seok Ma as Gilgamesh, Lia McHuch as Sprite, and Lauren Ridloff as Makkari. The Eternals if you couldn’t tell by the name are immortal beings, are tasked with protecting the Universe from evil humanoids call the Deviants.
<br>
<br>
Shang-chi might not sound familiar, but I bet you the Mandarin does. The Mandarin was teased over and over in “Iron Man 3” in 2013, but the “Mandarin” in “Iron Man 3” was a ruse for the real Mandarin. He is a ruthless comic-based villain who leads a group known as the “Ten Rings”, that might also sound familiar because that is the same group that captured Tony Stark in the original “Iron Man”. The Mandarin will be played by Hong Kong actor Tony Leung and he will be joined by actress Awkwafina. This is one example of how Marvel is fundamentally changing their movies and moving in a new direction.
<br>
<br>
“WandaVision” is the second Disney Plus streaming Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) show and it sounds like a good idea until you read when it takes place. It takes place after “Avengers: Endgame”! For those of you how don’t know Vison died in “Avengers: Infinity War” the movie before “Avengers: Endgame”, so either someone at Marvel who decided to make a show with a terrible name and a dead main character or someone at Marvel decided to bring back Vision and still have a show with a terrible name. Something else that is weird about this show is that the kid from “Captain Marvel” Monica Rambeau will be joining the cast of WandaVision played by Teyonah Parris, so we may get some cameos from Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel. This show is likely the adventures that Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff has with Paul Bettany’s resurrected Vision. WandaVision will also directly tie into the events Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness.
<br>
<br>
“Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness” is without a doubt the most interesting thing released in this Comic-Con. It is and I quote “The First Scary MCU Film” according to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, but according to Dr. Strange actor Benedict Cumberbatch they still want to keep the humor from the original Doctor Strange. This movie sounds incredible for two reasons. First, Marvel is truly breaking away from the same old, same old by making this a proper horror movie (I am not particularly fond of horror movies, but, interestingly, they are doing something different), and second, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Steven Strange or Doctor Strange as he is more commonly known get to truly explore multiple realities and universes. Another interesting thing is that Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch will join the cast to presumably help Doctor Strange on his journey into the multiverse. The Disney Plus show WandaVision somehow directly affects the events of this movie.
<br>
<br>
“Loki” is the third Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) show to stream exclusively on Disney Plus. It follows Tom Hiddleston’s Loki from the branch realities in “Avengers: Endgame”, where Loki steals back the Tesseract (the space stone) from S.H.E.I.L.D. after the events of “The Avengers”. The show will likely follow Loki while he messes up the timeline as his full evil self, not the nicer version of himself in “Thor: Ragnarok” because that never took place in that universe.
<br>
<br>
“What If…?” Is an animated Disney Plus show and the fourth (partial) Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney Plus streaming show. Although it is animated it will still star the voices from some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It will be narrated by Jeffrey Wright’s the Watcher, a multiverse dwelling being who watches over different universes and may or may not intervene in situations. It explores what would happen in hypothetical situations such as, “What would happen if Sharon Carter became Captain America instead of Steve Rodgers?”.
<br>
<br>
"Hawkeye” is the fifth exclusive Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Disney Plus show. Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton or as he is more commonly known Hawkeye will start of the series by continuing Hawkeye’s storyline as his alter ego Ronin, after the events of “Avengers: Endgame”. Ronin is Hawkeye pushed to the extreme he will kill almost anyone he considers bad, evil, or corrupt. Barton will have to learn to get over his losses, so he can properly teach Kate Bishop to become the new Hawkeye.
<br>
<br>
“Thor: Love and Thunder” will star Chris Harmsworth as Thor Odinson, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, and possibly as a female Thor and Tressa Thompson as Valkyrie. The story will likely have Jane Foster take over the role of being Thor as the real Thor Odinson explores the universe with the Guardians of the Galaxy.
<br>
<br>
The fourth phase Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to be a promising next chapter for Marvel. We will have to wait during the weeks and months to come to find out if Marvel has yet again pulled off another successful phase, but I think it safe to say that at very least this will be an interesting chapter in Marvel's history.
