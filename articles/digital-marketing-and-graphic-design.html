<p>Digital marketing and Graphic Design are so closely intertwined that sometimes you may think that you could not have one without the other. Digital marketing is the act of advertising things on electronic devices. Graphic Design is any art created on an electrical or mechanical device. Graphic Design could be as simple as elementary typography or as complicated as editing films. While you can have graphic design without digital marketing you can not have digital marketing without graphic design.
  <br>
  <br>
The term Digital market has been around since 1990, but it did not truly take a major effect of the internet world until 1993 when the first clickable web-ad banner was published. After that first advertisement, other organizations began to see how useful and profitable, advertisements could be, but they also realized that with the sudden demand for digital advertisements that they needed to be able to graphically design advertisements that represented their company well. Graphic designing was around well before digital marketing was even conceived graphic design started in the 1440s! You might be wondering how that is possible to have graphic design in the 1400s because computers came out in the 1900s, but graphic design does not necessarily have to be digitally produced. The first case of proper graphic design was done on the printing press, where people would advertise their products or services. Even back then it was widely used, but I do not that anyone back then could even imagine the rate at which it has grown.
<br>
<br>
To digitally market anything, you need to be able to show it on the viewer’s screen, which in and of its self is a type of Graphic Design and that conclusively proves how closely connected digital marketing and graphic design truly are. The individuals who produce the digital advertisements want to capture the viewer's eye, so whatever they are advertising becomes known to the viewer, so they may graphically design the advertisement to have immense, bold, and colorful images and text. They also might what their brand to look fun, sophisticated, or some other attribute that they need graphic designers to produce. Digital marketing and graphic designing have become so essential to companies around the world that it could make or break them.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, digital marketing and graphic design are practically inseparable. Companies rely on digital marketing to make their products sell and to make their company look a certain way and digital marketing relies on graphic design to make that feasible. In a larger since a lot of the modern economy partially relies on graphic design for it to truly function at its best.
