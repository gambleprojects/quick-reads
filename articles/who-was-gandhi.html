<h1 class="title">Who was Gandhi?</h1>
<h2 class="author">By: Camden B. Gamble</h2>

<hr>
<p>Mohandas Gandhi is one of the most revered and influential people that ever walked this earth. He accomplished many things that to this day astonish even the brightest among us, one of the most remarkable things he accomplished is helping the Indians pursue independence from Great Britain. He advocated for non-violent protest and civil disobedience that later was shown to have a direct impact on the Indian’s freedom. Mohandas Gandhi is truly one of India’s, if not one of the world’s most prominent historical figures.
<br>
<br>
Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in the city of Porbandar, Kathiawar, India. At that time this region was ruled by the British Empire and had been for around eleven years. Although Gandhi grew up to become one of the biggest role models and a person people only dreamed to live up to, he had a rather average, if not mischievous childhood. He regularly rebelled against his quite religious parents by smoking, eating meat (which was forbidden by his parents), and stealing change from his household’s servants. Gandhi was not quite as tough as his unorthodox activities might make him sound because, in reality, he was a rather timid child who reportedly could not properly sleep without his lights on, even as a teenager.
<br>
<br>
Mohandas' school life was quite unremarkable as a child, although he dreamt of becoming a medical doctor, which typically requires many years of dedicated schooling. His father was not too keen on the thought of his son becoming a doctor and he persuaded his son to study law instead, so Mohandas gave up his former ambitions and decided to study law in the city of London, England. While in England he decided to take his religious studies more seriously, he became a vegetarian and decided to live a life not focused on materialism. After his studies where complete he returned to India in 1891, where he learned his mother had died only weeks earlier. It is unclear whether it was this tragic news or the fact he was not destined for just the courtroom, but he struggled immensely at trying to become a lawyer. This is proven in his first real court case, where he forgot what he was supposed to do when cross-examining a witness. He immediately left the courtroom and later reimbursed his unhappy client’s legal fees.
<br>
<br>
To compensate for his lackluster and less than perfect record as a lawyer Gandhi decided to take a contract in South Africa that stated that he would perform legal services there for one year. Gandhi was quickly mortified by the racial segregation and discrimination that was presented to Indian immigrants by the white British and Boer authorities in South Africa. Despite his disgust, Gandhi decided to go ahead with his plan and went to his designated courthouse. When he arrived at his destination Gandhi was asked to remove turban, which is a traditional part of his cultural clothing, this infuriated him and instead of complying, he left the courtroom. The courthouse was not the only place where Gandhi faced racial discrimination, one of the most prominent examples of this is on a train that he took to Pretoria, South Africa. On this occasion, Gandhi was rightfully ridding in the first-class railway compartment, when a white man complained about his presence. Gandhi was told to move to the back of the train even though he had a ticket and he refused. Due to Gandhi’s first act of public civil disobedience, he was forcibly removed from the train. Gandhi vowed that night that he would fight color prejudice and that he would try to help people out in the process. That moment was the turning point in Gandhi’s life that turned a simple Indian lawyer into one of the most revolutionary figures in all of history.
<br>
<br>
Gandhi was now a new man, invigorated by the past unfortunate events he decided to form the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 to fight against racial discrimination. As his contract was nearing its end and Gandhi was preparing to go home, he learned that there was a bill that could potentially be put into law by the Natal Legislative Assembly that would prevent Indians from having the right to vote. Indians in the region where furious with such a blatantly racist bill and they convinced Gandhi to stay and lead the fight against the bill. Despite Gandhi’s effort, the bill was still put into law, but he drew international attention to the travesties that were plaguing the region.
<br>
<br>
Gandhi had a wife, children, and a successful legal business in South Africa in the late 1890s and into the early 1900s. All was going well for Gandhi until 1906 when the South African Transvaal government imposed new restrictions on Indians. This legislation led Gandhi to create his first mass civil-disobedience campaign. Hundreds of Indians where being imprisoned for the protests including Gandhi himself.
<br>
<br>
Gandhi returned to India in 1914 and lived a life devoted to his religious duties. Most of his day consisted of praying, meditating. Gandhi’s happy and peaceful lifestyle was abruptly disrupted by the British instituting the Rowlatt Act, this allowed the British to arrest anyone suspected of trying to start a revolution to be imprisoned without trial. Gandhi called for people to peacefully protest this act, but instead of peaceful protest, there was violence. On April 13, 1919, the British shoot machine guns into crowds filled with hundreds of unarmed protests. Four-hundred people died that day. This event leads Gandhi to be unable to pelage his allegiance to the British Government.
<br>
<br>
Gandhi was unable to back to his life of rest, instead, he would have to fight the British government the only way he knew how, with peaceful protesting. He begged government offices to stop work for a government that could do such a thing to its people, he called for students to stop going to government schools, he asked members of the military to abandon their posts and for the everyday citizen to stop paying taxes and buying British goods, to summarize he called for the complete and total boycott of the British government.
<br>
<br>
After all of Gandhi’s protests, he was arrested for sedition in 1922. He was released in 1924. After his arrest, Gandhi tried to stay out of politics for a while, but he was soon back in, due to more unfair legislation. The process of protesting legislation and getting arrested for it occurred multiple times, until 1947 when all of his work and suffering finally paid off and India became an independent country.
